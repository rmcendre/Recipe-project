        <h3>Odin Cheese Corn</h3>
        <img src="../pictures/cheese-corn.jpg" alt="Cheese Corn">
        <p>Cheese corn is a Koren comfort food made with corn, maynonnaise and cheese.</p>
        <p>This cheese corn recipe is a base for how you would like to fix it. Add in some hot peppers, some ham or crab.
            You can just make it your own, and really can't go wrong. Personally I like my Chsse Corn with some crushed red peppers, and diced fried Spam.
