        <h3>Odin Shrimp and Grits</h3>
        <img src="../pictures/shrimp_and_grits.jpg" alt="shrimp and grits">
        <p>A traditional Cajun dish made of Grits, Sausage, and Shrimp</p>
        <p>Some people might be turned off from trying this dish, because it has grits in it, however these are not the grits that you think of as being part of a breakfast
            meal. These grits are thick, rich, and oh so creamy, with the bite that comes from the cheddar cheese.
        </p>
        <p>This is really 2 recipes in 1, the grits make a nice base for so many other foods. Serve them as a side with some pan seared pork, or take out the shrimp, and 
            have some simple Sausage and Grits. For an extra kick add in some garlic to the grits.
        </p>
